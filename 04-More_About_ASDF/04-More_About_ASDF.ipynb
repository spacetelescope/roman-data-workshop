    "Recall that ASDF files store their information using a tree (nested key/value) structure.\n",
    "This allows the stored information to be hierarchically organized with the file. Fundamentally,\n",
    "this tree is a nested combination of basic structures:\n",
    "- maps (forming the tree structure itself),\n",
    "- lists,\n",
    "- arrays,\n",
    "- strings,\n",
    "- booleans,\n",
    "- and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of which are stored using `yaml`. Note that more complex structures are denoted using\n",
    "`yaml` tags, but those tagged structures are still comprised of the above basic structures,\n",
    "and that these additional tagged objects are generally supported via ASDF extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python analogs to these basic structures are:\n",
    "- maps -> `dict`\n",
    "- lists -> `list`\n",
    "- arrays -> `np.ndarray`\n",
    "- strings -> `str`\n",
    "- booleans -> `bool`\n",
    "- numbers -> `int`, `float`, `complex` (depending on type of number).\n",
    "\n",
    "One special note is that although `yaml` supports a more general notion of what keys\n",
    "are allowable within a map, the limitations of Python have restricted ASDF to only allowing\n",
    "`bool`, `int`, or `str` types as keys."
